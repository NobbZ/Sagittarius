## What is Sagittarius?

Sagittarius is meant to be a project management tool, which shall integrate well with github, bitbucket and others.

## Why did you create Sagittarius?

We started with Sagittarius, because on the Rails-Mailinglist, there was a guy asking for contributors for a learning project, giving everyone the opportunity to learn rails by joining a project right at the beginning.

After about 3 weeks he vanished and also his github account and website.

So three of us (the team3x) met again and planned how to continue. After about 2 weeks of doing nothing, we decided to throw away everything related to that project from the mailinglist.

We wanted to start from scratch, something new, so after a short discussion we sorted out blogs, wikis and bulletin boards and the project management tool won.

And here we are!
